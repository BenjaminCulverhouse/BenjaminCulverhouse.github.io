title: About me
---

My name is Benjamin Culverhouse. I am currently a junior in the computer science department
at Virginia Tech. I am interested in the broad field of software engineering, creating 
applications and webpages. 

I have a general interest in technology and how it relates to the world that we live in.
I hope to have the ability to create new and robust systems that can address issues that 
people have as well as enable new ways to increase the effectiveness and productivity of
people using web-based applications.
