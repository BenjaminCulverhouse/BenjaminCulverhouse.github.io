    <ins>Covid Visualization Project – Java</ins>
        <ul>
            <li>Created a program that read in data about covid cases per state per ethnicity and displayed that data in a graph.</li></ins>
        </ul>
    <ins>MIPS Assembler Project – C</ins>
        <ul>
            <li>Created a C program that assembled a limited MIPS instruction set. Included more intricate assembler processes such as replacing labels with addresses, as well as supporting some pseudo-instructions.</li></ins>
        </ul>
    <ins>Cush - C</ins>
        <ul>
            <li>Created a customizable shell in C that implements general job control and process management principles.</li>
            <li>Support for foreground and background jobs.</li> 
            <li>Signal handling of different signals (^C SIGINT, ^Z SIGSTP), multiple built-ins such as jobs, fg, bg, killProcess, stop, history.</li>
            <li>Command piping is also supported as well as io redirection.</li>
        </ul>
    <ins>Threadpool - C</ins>
    <ul>
        <li>Created a work-stealing threadpool using the C language using pthread convention.</li>
        <li>Locks and acquisition of locks were written in a way to guarantee least the amount of lock contention and best effciency when completing tasks.</li>
    </ul>
    <ins>Personal Server - C</ins>
    <ul>
        <li>Created a personal server in C that had features such as effcient video hosting, user authentication, and multiple user suppoert.</li>
